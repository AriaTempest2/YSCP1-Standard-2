# Tip Calculator

## Overview
This project is a Python-based Tip Calculator that allows users to input a bill amount and tip percentage. The program calculates the tip and displays both the tip and total bill amounts with appropriate formatting.

## Project Overview
### Students will build a Python program that:
- Prompts the user for the total bill amount
- Asks for the desired tip percentage
- Calculates the tip amount
- Displays both the tip and the total bill (including the tip), with proper formatting (e.g., two decimal places and a dollar sign).

### This project is designed to help students demonstrate:
- Good Programming Style: proper whitespace, 
- Naming conventions, use of constants and variables, and out formatting.
- An understanding of the Software Development Lifecycle: 
   * requirements analysis, 
   * planning/design with pseudocode and UML diagram, 
   * implementation, 
   * testing, 
   * release.

## Files to Include:
- tip_calculator.py - actual Python code
- pseudocode.txt - Python "Like" Code to build your Algorithm
- uml_diagram.png - Create on Canva UML 

## How to Use
1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code via GitHub Codespaces.
2. Run the program with:
   python3 tip_calculator.py
